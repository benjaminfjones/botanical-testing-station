## Blog N+1, Post 0

Here's a new blog, in the [tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/).

A lot of folks in the tildeverse seem to enjoy writing HTML, channeling geocities.
While I don't dislike that, I feel like I'm too old to write anything other than
markdown and be happy that pandoc or hugo will compile to HTML for me.

Or maybe I just refuse to learn anything deep about the world wide web? On the other
hand my personal website is hand written HTML. But I started that long enough ago that
at this point it's all copy/paste when anything needs updating.

## More

### Generation

This version of the blog is generated by
[Marmite](https://github.com/rochacbruno/marmite) from a flat directory of
markdown files. Files with `date` metadata become blog posts, those without
become standalone pages.

### Math

Math markup and rendering isn't supported, at least not yet. I don't know if I'll enable
that or not. Writing ASCII math seems fine for a while.
